      <p>Skapples, Thanks for showing the ultimate focus and love in your product 👏👏 Every product could use a bit of that!<br><strong>-Preey Shah</strong></p>

      <p>As a user, I switched to Skapples for tracking my finances and it's a whole new world...literally life-changing. When I go to my "old" finance excel sheet and see the chaos there, it explains a lot about why people’s finances are in havoc...it's not us, it's the tools. It's my sincere hope that the tools will evolve to help users find what they want.

      <p>Just love how Skapples greets me with a beautiful screen as soon as I login. BTW, if you have no idea where your money is going and always feel tense about what reminder you’ve forgotten, just try Skapples once. It's the cutest finance app I have ever seen. Since I started using it, I believe my expense tracking time has gone down by about 60–70%. And no, Skapples didn't pay me to write this post! It's just a shoutout reward for building a product and service that customers not just like, but love. Have been using Skapples for about 3 months now, and my only complaint is why I didn't discover it earlier! PS: If you have a favorite app or tool that’s made your work-life better, let me know. Always on the lookout for great finds.<br><strong>-Rucha</strong></p>

      <p>What do you like best about Skapples? It's easy to review my spends and to get reminders for paying my taxes or to come back to my ITR in the future, allowing me to prioritize my work and focus on only the things I need to address right now. Skapples has saved me a bunch of money!<br><strong>-Gargi Upadhayay</strong></p>
